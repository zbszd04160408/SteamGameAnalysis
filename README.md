# SteamGameAnalysis

## Objective
Many people, including us, are game lovers, and weâ€™d like to provide some up-to-date game analysis for other gamers. In this way, we can also learn more about the game market and provide some insights based on game information.
      
## Dataset
The data was scraped by ourselves from store.steampowered.com. We saved these data as two datasets: Game_Info.csv and Game_Reviews.csv.
As the size of the dataset is over 5GB, we're not able to upload it to Github, therefore, we compressed it and uploaded it to Google Drive.
