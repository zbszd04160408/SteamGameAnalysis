# SteamGameAnalysis

## Objective
Many people, including us, are game lovers, and weâ€™d like to provide some up-to-date game analysis for other gamers. In this way, we can also learn more about the game market and provide some insights based on game information.
      
## Dataset
The data was scraped by ourselves from store.steampowered.com. We saved these data as two datasets: Game_Info.csv and Game_Reviews.csv.
The size of the dataset is over 5GB, we're not able to upload it to Github, therefore, we compressed it and uploaded it to Google Drive.

## Notebooks
**10-GameInfoCollection.ipynb:** In this notebook, we wrote code for scraping basic information of the games from Steam platform, and stored the data as Game_Info.csv.        
**11-GameReviewsCollection.ipynb:** In this notebook, we wrote code to obtain players' reviews for each game from Steam platform, and store the data as Game_Reviews.csv.     
**20-EDA.ipynb:** We used this notebook to performe exploratory data analysis on the Game_Info dataset to gain a better understanding of the data and tried to find out the columns in the game information that have a potential impact on the game's positive rating by visualizing them.
